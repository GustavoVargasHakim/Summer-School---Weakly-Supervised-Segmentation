# Summer School on Deep Learning for Medical Imaging - 3rd Edition
## Hands-on tutorial on Weakly Supervised Image Segmentation for Medical Images. 

This repository contains the code of the hands-on tutorial on Weakley Supervised Image Segmentation. It covers the following topics:
* **naive sizeloss**, to introduce the pipeline and general methodology;
* **combined size and centroid supervision**, with a quadratic penalty;
* combined size and centroid supervision, **with an extended log-barrier**.
